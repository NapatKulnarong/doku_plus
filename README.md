## ðŸ“¦ Installation Guide

To get DOKU+ running successfully on your system, please follow these detailed instructions:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have **Python 3.12 or a later version** installed. You can check your Python version by opening your terminal or command prompt and running:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    If you do not have Python 3.12 or later installed, please download it from the official Python website ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2.  **Install Dependencies:** DOKU+ relies on several external Python libraries. These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, navigate to the root directory of the DOKU+ project in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command will automatically download and install all the necessary libraries, including Pygame, Matplotlib, and NumPy. Ensure that this process completes without any errors.

Once you have successfully installed the prerequisites and dependencies, you can launch the DOKU+ game by following these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the DOKU+ project. This is the directory containing the `main.py` file.

2.  **Run the Game:** Execute the main script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    Press the Enter key after typing this command. The DOKU+ game window should now open, and you can begin playing.
